Dataset generated by MAOOAM

The dataset of coupled quasi-geostrophic system used in the paper "Fourier Reservoir Computing for data-driven prediction of multi-scale coupled quasi-geostrophic dynamics" is generated by the Modular arbitrary-order ocean-atmosphere model, which can be found in: https://github.com/Climdyn/MAOOAM. The dataset of a much longer model run can be found in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ibuIvmCcXt5RSNXZJ7-wgrtXifqmjGQ4?usp=sharing
